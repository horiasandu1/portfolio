					<blockquote>As soon as I got to the legal working age, I started looking into fun jobs where I would be working with a team. This led me to become a daycamp monitor, which helped me grow as a person and was great fun. Working closely with the lifeguards, I knew I wanted that job to be my next step so I got it done pretty quick. Within less than a year, I became certified and I was working the next summer. I met some great friends, had some tough experiences and had an uneven tan for years.</blockquote>

					<h2>More Details</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/jetski.jpg" alt="" /></span>After the first summer I loved my experience and wanted to take it further. I quickly became a swimming instructor. Used to working with people and with kids from previous experiences, I truly enjoyed this role and had some great students. Still needing to scratch an itch, I became an MS to teach higher level classes and train the teens who would become future lifeguards.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/face_cam.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 2019, I embarked on the ultimate experience. I left on a trip to Costa Rica with 36 other fellow lifeguards in order to become certified as ocean lifeguards. Tough on the body and on the soul, I came out of it with more experience, souvenirs that will last a lifetime and an amazing friend group. Coming back from the trip, I was promoted to head lifeguard for the summer of 2020. </p>
