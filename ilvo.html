					<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
					<blockquote>The goal here was to lead a year-long project consolidating all of my learnings from my CEGEP time. Instead of creating a simple website for a client who will never use it, I went above and beyond with my colleague Remi to create something that brought actual value to the stakeholders. </blockquote>

					<h2>Use Cases</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/supervisor.JPG" alt="" /></span>As a supervisor I can connect myself to the ILVO system, I can then go in and create a session in order to build an availability sheet for the lifeguards to fill out. Once the lifeguards have filled out these availability sheets I will then be able to see them and apply them to the schedule that is available on the shifts present in the diagram of the shift management tab. Once those have been created the report of which shifts are taking place one can be sent to administration in order for them to manage that schedule and send the employees their personalized schedules.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/lifeguard_screen.JPG" alt="" /></span>As a lifeguard I can connect to the ILVO system and put in my availabilities for the upcoming season of lifeguarding. Instead of having to take a document and submit it by email instead connect to the online system and directly give my availabilities through the customized availabilities form that my supervisor created once I clicked confirm the supervisor can directly have access to this in order to schedule me for shifts in the upcoming future.</p>
